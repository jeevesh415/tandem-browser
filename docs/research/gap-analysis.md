# Tandem vs Opera — Gap Analysis & Roadmap

> Generated: 2026-02-28
> Tandem v0.15.1 (380+ features) vs Opera Desktop (68 features)
> Purpose: Identify high-value Opera features to build into Tandem

---

## Executive Summary

After comparing all 68 Opera features against Tandem's 380+ feature inventory:

- **19 features** Opera has that Tandem **also has** (✅) — often Tandem exceeds Opera
- **17 features** Opera has that Tandem **partially has** (⚠️) — upgrade path exists
- **29 features** Opera has that Tandem **is missing** (❌) — new builds required
- **5 features** excluded per Robin's preferences (Facebook Messenger, VK, Cashback, Crypto Wallet, Continue Shopping)

### What Stands Out

Tandem **crushes** Opera on: AI integration (6-layer copilot vs Aria chatbot), security (6-layer shield vs basic blocklists), stealth/anti-detection (no Opera equivalent), agent automation (195+ API endpoints, MCP server, CLI), and developer tooling (CDP bridge, network mocking, device emulation).

Opera **crushes** Tandem on: sidebar messenger integration, tab organization UX (Islands, Workspaces UI, Split Screen), consumer privacy features (ad blocking, VPN, private browsing), content curation (Pinboards), and cross-device sync.

**The pattern:** Tandem is a power tool for AI-human symbiosis. Opera is a consumer browser with lifestyle features. The gap is in **consumer UX polish and sidebar productivity** — areas that would make Tandem more pleasant for daily driving.

### Top 10 Recommended Features to Build

| # | Feature | Why | Effort |
|---|---------|-----|--------|
| 1 | **Sidebar Chat Clients** | WhatsApp/Discord/Slack/Telegram/Instagram/X — Robin's #1 request | Hard (1-2 weeks) |
| 2 | **Pinboards** | Content curation boards with Kanban — Robin loves these | Hard (1-2 weeks) |
| 3 | **Tab Islands** (upgrade) | Auto-grouping, collapsing, naming — beyond basic tab groups | Medium (3-5 days) |
| 4 | **Split Screen** | Multi-pane browsing in single window — power user essential | Medium (3-5 days) |
| 5 | **Workspaces UI** | Visual workspace switching on top of /sessions | Medium (3-5 days) |
| 6 | **Tab Emojis** | Emoji badges on tabs — Robin likes this | Easy (1-2 days) |
| 7 | **Search in Tabs** | Ctrl+Space tab search popup | Easy (1-2 days) |
| 8 | **Ad Blocker** (consumer) | Block ads, not just malicious URLs — table stakes | Medium (3-5 days) |
| 9 | **Tab Snoozing** | Auto-suspend inactive tabs for memory savings | Medium (3-5 days) |
| 10 | **Private Browsing Window** | Ephemeral window that deletes all data on close | Easy (1-2 days) |

## Deep Dives

### Pinboards — Full Spec

#### What Opera Offers
Opera Pinboards are virtual "magnetic boards" — canvas-style spaces for collecting and organizing web content:

**Content types supported:**
- Text notes / annotations
- Web links (with preview cards)
- Images (drag-and-drop or right-click save)
- Screenshots
- YouTube video embeds (playback within board)
- Music files
- Documents

**Organization:**
- Free-form drag-and-drop arrangement on a canvas
- **Kanban board mode** — "To Do / In Progress / Done" columns
- Multiple boards (travel planning, shopping, design, vision boards)
- Each board is a separate named space

**Collaboration:**
- Share any board via link (copies shareable URL to clipboard)
- No login required for viewers — anyone with the link can view
- Emoji reactions from viewers (collaborative feedback)
- Cross-device sync via Opera account

**Access points:**
- Sidebar icon
- opera://pinboards
- Right-click any content → "Save to Pinboard"
- "New pinboard" button

#### What Tandem Currently Has
- `POST /context/note` — Add text notes to any page (per-URL)
- Bookmarks with folders — basic content collection
- Session state save — save/restore tab groups
- No visual board/canvas, no card layout, no Kanban

#### Implementation Plan for Tandem

**Architecture:**
```
src/pinboard-manager.ts          — Core pinboard data model + persistence
src/routes/pinboard-routes.ts    — REST API endpoints
shell/pinboard.html              — Pinboard UI (tandem://pinboards)
shell/pinboard-card.html         — Card component
```

**Data Model:**
```typescript
interface Pinboard {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
  layout: 'freeform' | 'kanban';
  kanbanColumns?: string[];  // e.g., ["To Do", "In Progress", "Done"]
  cards: PinboardCard[];
}

interface PinboardCard {
  id: string;
  type: 'note' | 'link' | 'image' | 'screenshot' | 'video';
  title?: string;
  content: string;          // text, URL, or image path
  thumbnail?: string;       // preview image
  position: { x: number; y: number };  // freeform layout
  column?: string;          // kanban column
  color?: string;
  createdAt: string;
}
```

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /pinboards` — list all pinboards
- `POST /pinboards` — create new pinboard
- `GET /pinboards/:id` — get pinboard with cards
- `PUT /pinboards/:id` — update pinboard (name, layout)
- `DELETE /pinboards/:id` — delete pinboard
- `POST /pinboards/:id/cards` — add card
- `PUT /pinboards/:id/cards/:cardId` — update card (move, edit)
- `DELETE /pinboards/:id/cards/:cardId` — remove card

**UI Features:**
- Canvas with drag-and-drop cards (use CSS grid for Kanban, absolute positioning for freeform)
- Right-click context menu integration: "Save to Pinboard" for links, images, selections
- Sidebar panel option (new tab in copilot panel, or dedicated sidebar icon)
- Card preview with favicon, title, thumbnail for links
- Keyboard shortcut (Cmd+Shift+P could conflict with PiP — use Cmd+Shift+I or similar)

**Storage:** SQLite (extend existing database) or JSON file in `~/.tandem/pinboards/`

**Effort:** Hard — 1-2 weeks. The canvas UI (especially freeform drag-and-drop) is the most complex part. Kanban is easier with CSS grid. V1 could ship Kanban-only and add freeform later.

**V1 scope (1 week):** Kanban boards with note/link/image cards, context menu integration, sidebar access
**V2 scope (+1 week):** Freeform canvas, YouTube embeds, share via link, screenshot cards

### Sidebar Chat Clients — Full Spec

#### What Opera Offers
Each messenger (WhatsApp, Discord, Slack, Telegram, Instagram, X) runs as a **sidebar webview panel** — essentially a narrow BrowserView pinned to the left side of the window, independent of the main tab content.

**Per-panel features:**
- Pin/unpin (always visible vs toggle)
- Mute notifications per panel
- Log in/out independently
- Notification badges on sidebar icons
- Panel width adjustable
- Three-dot menu per panel (mute/hide/logout)

**Sidebar architecture:**
- Vertical icon strip on the left edge
- Click icon → panel slides out from left
- Multiple panels can exist but only one visible at a time
- Each panel has its own session/cookies (isolated from main browsing)

#### Implementation Path in Electron/Tandem

**Architecture:**
```
src/sidebar-manager.ts           — Manages sidebar panels, state, notifications
src/routes/sidebar-routes.ts     — API for sidebar panel management
shell/sidebar.html               — Sidebar icon strip + panel container
```

**Core concept:** Each chat client is a `BrowserView` (or `WebContentsView` in modern Electron) with a fixed URL:

| Service | URL | Notes |
|---------|-----|-------|
| WhatsApp | `https://web.whatsapp.com` | QR code login, works in webview |
| Discord | `https://discord.com/app` | Standard login, full web app |
| Slack | `https://app.slack.com` | Workspace login, full web app |
| Telegram | `https://web.telegram.org` | QR code or phone login |
| Instagram | `https://www.instagram.com` | Standard login, full web app |
| X/Twitter | `https://x.com` | Standard login, full web app |

**Implementation steps:**

1. **Sidebar icon strip** — Vertical strip of icons on the left edge of the shell window (separate from the copilot panel which is on the right). Each icon represents a configured chat client.

2. **Panel management** — When an icon is clicked, create or show a `BrowserView` attached to the left side of the window, between the icon strip and the main content area. Width adjustable (default ~400px).

3. **Session isolation** — Each sidebar panel uses its own Electron `partition` (e.g., `persist:sidebar-whatsapp`) so login state is independent from main browsing and from other panels.

4. **Notification badges** — Use `webContents` event listeners to detect notifications:
   - Monitor `page-title-updated` for unread count changes (WhatsApp uses "({count}) WhatsApp")
   - Use `page-favicon-updated` for notification indicator changes
   - Inject JS to observe notification badges in the DOM where needed

5. **Panel state persistence** — Save which panels are configured, their widths, and mute states to `~/.tandem/sidebar-config.json`

6. **User-Agent considerations** — Some services (WhatsApp Web) require a specific User-Agent. The sidebar webviews should use a standard Chrome UA, not the Tandem stealth UA.

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /sidebar/panels` — list configured panels
- `POST /sidebar/panels` — add new panel (service, position)
- `DELETE /sidebar/panels/:id` — remove panel
- `POST /sidebar/panels/:id/toggle` — show/hide panel
- `POST /sidebar/panels/:id/mute` — toggle notification mute
- `GET /sidebar/panels/:id/status` — get panel status (notifications, logged in)

**Key technical challenges:**
- **WhatsApp Web** requires specific conditions: must present as Chrome desktop browser, needs persistent localStorage for encryption keys. Works well in Electron BrowserView with `persist:` partition.
- **Discord** may show CAPTCHAs on first login from a new "browser." Consider using Tandem's stealth mode for the sidebar webview.
- **Slack** workspace switching within the sidebar panel works natively.
- **Panel width vs content** — Most web apps have responsive layouts, but some (Discord) have minimum widths. Default to 420px, allow resize.

**Effort:** Hard — 1-2 weeks for the full system. But a V1 with just the sidebar framework + WhatsApp/Discord could ship in 3-5 days.

**V1 (3-5 days):** Sidebar icon strip, panel framework, WhatsApp + Discord + Slack
**V2 (+3-5 days):** Telegram, Instagram, X, notification badges, mute, panel reordering

### Tab Islands — Implementation Plan

#### Current State in Tandem
Tandem has `POST /tabs/group` which creates Chromium tab groups with colors. This uses Electron's `tabs.group()` API. Tab groups appear as colored labels in the tab bar.

#### Gap: What Opera Islands Add Beyond Basic Groups
1. **Auto-creation** — When you open tabs from a link (same origin), they automatically form an island. No manual grouping needed.
2. **Visual design** — Color-coded handles above grouped tabs with subtle connecting lines/shading, not just a label
3. **Collapsible** — Click an island handle to collapse all its tabs into a single tab-width indicator
4. **Named handles** — Each island can have a custom name displayed on the handle
5. **Multi-tab selection** — Shift+click to select multiple tabs, then drag to form or merge islands
6. **Hover preview** — Tooltip showing thumbnails of all tabs in a collapsed island

#### Specific Code Changes Needed

**1. Auto-grouping logic** (`src/tab-manager.ts`):
```typescript
// Track tab opener chains
// When tab B is opened from tab A (via window.open or link click),
// auto-add tab B to tab A's group
// Use webContents 'new-window' event and 'did-create-window'
// to detect parent-child tab relationships

interface TabIsland {
  id: string;
  name?: string;
  color: string;
  collapsed: boolean;
  tabIds: number[];
  originDomain?: string;  // auto-group by origin
}
```

**2. Shell-side island UI** (`shell/index.html` tab bar):
- Replace simple group label with island handle element
- Add collapse/expand click handler
- Add name editing (double-click handle)
- Add visual connections between tabs in same island
- Handle drag-and-drop between islands

**3. Collapse behavior** (`shell/index.html`):
- When collapsed: show only the island handle with a count badge
- When expanded: show all tabs normally with island color styling
- Store collapse state in tab manager

**4. New API endpoints** (`src/routes/tab-routes.ts`):
- `POST /tabs/island/create` — create island from selected tabs
- `POST /tabs/island/:id/collapse` — toggle collapse
- `POST /tabs/island/:id/rename` — rename island
- `GET /tabs/islands` — list all islands with their tabs

**5. Settings** (`src/config-manager.ts`):
- `autoCreateIslands: boolean` — auto-group tabs opened from same origin
- `islandAutoGroupThreshold: number` — minimum tabs from same origin to auto-create island (default: 2)

**Effort:** Medium — 3-5 days. The auto-grouping logic is straightforward (track opener chains). The main effort is the shell-side UI for island handles, collapse animation, and drag-and-drop.

### Split Screen — Implementation Plan

#### Does Tandem Have This?
No. Tandem currently shows one webview at a time in the main content area. There is no multi-pane support.

#### How to Build in Electron

**Approach:** Use multiple `BrowserView` (or `WebContentsView`) instances arranged in a grid layout within the main window area.

**Architecture:**
```
src/split-screen-manager.ts      — Manages split layouts and pane webviews
src/routes/split-routes.ts       — API endpoints
shell/split-controls.html        — Split screen toolbar/controls
```

**Layout modes:**
```
┌─────────┐   ┌────┬────┐   ┌─────────┐   ┌────┬────┐
│         │   │    │    │   │         │   │    │    │
│  Single │   │ V1 │ V2 │   ├─────────┤   ├────┼────┤
│         │   │    │    │   │         │   │    │    │
└─────────┘   └────┴────┘   └─────────┘   └────┴────┘
  1 pane      2 vertical    2 horizontal   4 grid (2x2)
```

**Implementation:**

1. **SplitScreenManager** tracks active split state:
```typescript
interface SplitLayout {
  mode: 'single' | 'vertical-2' | 'horizontal-2' | 'grid-4';
  panes: SplitPane[];
}

interface SplitPane {
  tabId: number;
  bounds: { x: number; y: number; width: number; height: number };
}
```

2. **Entering split screen:**
   - Drag a tab downward (in shell tab bar) → split current + dragged tab
   - Shift+click two tabs → right-click → "Split Screen"
   - API: `POST /split/create` with tab IDs

3. **Pane management:**
   - Each pane is a separate `BrowserView` with its own webContents
   - Resizable dividers between panes (track mouse position for resize)
   - Each pane has independent navigation (address bar shows active pane's URL)

4. **Divider resize** — CSS + JS mouse event handling in shell. Track mousedown on divider, mousemove updates `BrowserView.setBounds()` for adjacent panes.

5. **Active pane focus** — Click on a pane to make it "active." The toolbar (URL bar, back/forward) controls the active pane. Visual indicator (blue border) on active pane.

6. **Exiting split screen:**
   - Close a pane → remaining tab becomes single
   - Right-click → "Exit Split Screen"
   - API: `POST /split/close`

**API Endpoints:**
- `POST /split/create` — enter split screen with specified tabs
- `GET /split/status` — current split layout
- `POST /split/layout` — change layout mode
- `POST /split/close` — exit split screen
- `POST /split/focus/:paneIndex` — focus specific pane

**Key challenge:** The main Tandem content area currently uses a single `<webview>` tag in the shell HTML. Split screen requires switching to multiple managed `BrowserView` instances OR multiple `<webview>` tags with CSS layout. The `BrowserView` approach is more robust but requires changes to how Tandem manages its main content area.

**Effort:** Medium — 3-5 days for 2-pane split. Grid (4-pane) adds 1-2 more days. The main risk is refactoring the single-webview assumption in the shell.

### Workspaces — /sessions vs Opera Workspaces Comparison

#### Tandem /sessions
- **Full partition isolation** — each session has separate cookies, localStorage, cache
- **API-driven** — `POST /sessions/create`, `POST /sessions/switch`, `POST /sessions/destroy`
- **CLI support** — `tandem session create/switch/list/destroy`
- **State persistence** — save/load session state (tabs, URLs) to disk
- **No UI** — no visual workspace switcher, no sidebar icons, no keyboard shortcuts for switching
- **Unlimited sessions** — no cap on number

#### Opera Workspaces
- **Visual switching** — sidebar icons for each workspace, one-click switch
- **Shared session** — all workspaces share cookies/login state (just tab organization)
- **Tab scoping** — Ctrl+Tab only cycles within current workspace
- **Named + iconified** — custom name and icon per workspace
- **5 workspace limit**
- **Tab context menu** — "Move tab to workspace" option
- **Link context menu** — "Open link in workspace"

#### Key Difference
Tandem sessions are **deeper** (full cookie isolation) while Opera workspaces are **shallower** (just tab organization). These serve different purposes:
- **Sessions** = different identities (logged into different accounts)
- **Workspaces** = different contexts (same identity, organized by task)

#### What Tandem Needs
Tandem should keep /sessions for identity isolation AND add a Workspaces layer for tab organization:

```typescript
interface Workspace {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  icon: string;        // emoji or icon name
  color: string;
  tabIds: number[];    // tabs belonging to this workspace
  isActive: boolean;
}
```

**Implementation:**
1. Add workspace data model to tab-manager.ts
2. Add workspace icons to sidebar (or new workspace strip)
3. When switching workspace: hide all non-workspace tabs, show workspace tabs
4. Add "Move tab to workspace" in tab context menu
5. Scope Cmd+Tab (or Ctrl+Tab) to current workspace

**Effort:** Medium — 3-5 days. The tab-hiding/showing logic is the core challenge. Workspace state persistence needs to survive browser restart.

**Relationship to Sessions:** Workspaces and Sessions are orthogonal. A workspace organizes tabs within a session. Users could have Session "Personal" with Workspaces "Shopping" and "Research," and Session "Work" with Workspaces "Project A" and "Email."

## What Tandem Has That Opera Doesn't

These are Tandem's unique advantages — capabilities Opera simply doesn't offer:

| Category | Tandem Feature | Opera Equivalent |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| **AI Copilot** | 6-layer AI copilot with MCP server, 25 tools, multi-backend (OpenClaw + Claude), dual mode, emergency stop, task approval workflow | Aria chatbot (single model, no tool use, no agent autonomy) |
| **Security Shield** | 6-layer defense: NetworkShield, OutboundGuard, ContentAnalyzer, BehaviorMonitor, GatekeeperAI, EvolutionEngine. YARA rules, AST fingerprinting, Shannon entropy, zero-day tracking | Basic ad blocker + phishing blacklist |
| **Stealth/Anti-Detection** | Canvas/WebGL/Audio/Font fingerprint protection. Electron concealment. OS-level click injection. Per-character human typing. Chrome API mocking. Full UA spoofing | None — Opera is fully detectable |
| **Behavioral Learning** | Learn user's typing rhythm, mouse curves, scroll patterns. Replay as humanized automation | None |
| **Agent Automation** | 195+ REST API endpoints. JavaScript execution with approval gates. Accessibility tree snapshots. Playwright-style locators. Headless browsing. Workflow engine | None — no programmatic control |
| **CLI** | 12 commands for terminal-based browser control (`tandem open`, `tandem click`, `tandem snapshot`) | None |
| **MCP Server** | Full Model Context Protocol integration — any MCP client can control the browser | None |
| **DevTools Bridge** | CDP endpoints for console, network, DOM, performance, storage access via API | Standard DevTools only (manual) |
| **Network Mocking** | Intercept and mock HTTP requests via CDP for testing | None |
| **Device Emulation** | Predefined device profiles (iPhone, iPad, Pixel) via API | None (some via DevTools) |
| **Drawing/Annotation** | 6 tools (arrow, rect, circle, free line, text, colors) with snap-for-copilot | Basic screenshot crop only |
| **Voice Input** | Speech-to-text with multi-language support, auto-send on silence | Aria has voice input, but less configurable |
| **ClaroNote** | Voice recording → transcription integration | None |
| **Site Memory** | Per-domain visit tracking, time spent, content change detection | Basic history only |
| **Scheduled Watches** | Monitor URLs for changes on schedule, alert on diff | None |
| **Form Memory** | Remember form inputs per domain | Basic autofill only |
| **Tab Source Marking** | Mark tabs as robin-owned vs copilot-owned | None |
| **Tab Lock Manager** | Exclusive agent access locks on tabs | None |
| **Content Extraction** | Smart page-to-markdown extraction | None |
| **X-Scout** | Dedicated X/Twitter intelligence agent | None |
| **Password Manager** | AES-256-GCM encrypted local vault, per-item salt/IV, zero cloud | Opera uses third-party sync |

**Bottom line:** Tandem is vastly more powerful than Opera for AI-augmented browsing, security, automation, and developer workflows. The gap is primarily in **consumer UX features** — sidebar messengers, tab organization polish, and lifestyle features that make a browser pleasant for daily use. Closing these gaps makes Tandem competitive as a daily driver while retaining its unique superpowers.
