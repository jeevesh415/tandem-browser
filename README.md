# Tandem Browser

Tandem Browser is a local-first Electron browser built for human-AI collaboration.
The human browses normally. The AI gets a local API on `127.0.0.1:8765` for
navigation, extraction, automation, and observability. Websites should only see
an ordinary Chromium browser on macOS or Linux, not an “AI browser”.

Tandem is opinionated about security. If an AI can read and act on live web
content, the browser becomes part of the threat model. Tandem puts a layered
security system between external content and the agent, with local-only data
handling and no cloud dependency in the browser itself.

## What It Does

- Human + AI shared browsing: a normal browser UI for the human, a local HTTP API for the agent
- Local API for automation: navigation, page content, screenshots, tabs, sessions, devtools-style endpoints, and more
- Security-by-default browsing: blocklists, outbound checks, script analysis, behavior monitoring, and an agent decision layer
- Extension support: Chrome-style extension loading, native messaging compatibility work, and extension update management
- Local-first data model: sessions, settings, history, workspaces, and browser state stay on the machine

## Current Status

- Primary platform: macOS
- Secondary platform: Linux
- Windows: not actively validated yet
- Current release: see [package.json](/Users/robinwaslander/Documents/dev/tandem-browser/package.json) and [CHANGELOG.md](/Users/robinwaslander/Documents/dev/tandem-browser/CHANGELOG.md)

## Architecture

Tandem runs two layers in parallel:

1. The visible browsing layer: Chromium webviews, tabs, downloads, bookmarks, workspaces, and the human-facing UI.
2. The invisible control layer: Electron main process services, the local HTTP API, security systems, and the agent tooling.

This split matters because Tandem is designed to keep AI control out of the page
JavaScript context whenever possible.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm
- macOS or Linux

### Install

```bash
npm install
```

### Compile

```bash
npm run compile
```

### Start

```bash
npm start
```

On macOS, the start script clears Electron quarantine flags before launch.

## Development

Useful commands:

```bash
npm run compile
npm test
npm run lint
npm run build
```

The local API binds to `127.0.0.1:8765`.

## Public API Snapshot

Examples:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8765/status

curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8765/navigate \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"url":"https://example.com"}'

curl http://127.0.0.1:8765/page-content

curl http://127.0.0.1:8765/screenshot --output screen.png
```

## Security Model

Tandem treats external web content as hostile by default. The current stack includes:

- network-level blocking and threat feeds
- outbound request checks
- runtime script inspection
- behavior monitoring
- an AI-facing decision layer for ambiguous cases

This is a browser for agent-assisted work, so the project is intentionally more
paranoid than a normal desktop browser shell.
